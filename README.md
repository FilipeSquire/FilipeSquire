### Watch out!

I'm a Data Scientist wannabe! I'm currently working as a Data Analyst and I do Data Science work as my extra-activities in my life.

I love working with maps 🗺️ and Government Data, that's why you'll find many works related to Education, Economy, Politics and others

I'm most interested in working with Data related to Customer's Relationship Management (LTV,ROI,CAC..) and Geographic Correlations

<b> I'm a Senior Information Systems Bachelor in Brazil ! 👨🏻‍🎓 </b>

<b> I'm currently a Candidate for Master's of Computer Science at University of Porto, University of Buenos Aires and University of São Paulo 👨🏻‍🔬 </b>

<b> My previous experiences as Data Analyst were mainly focused on: CRM 💌 and Strategic Marketing 💹 </b>
